Program Steps or Program Flow

    Interactive python is good for experiments and programs of 3-4 lines long

    Most programs are much longer, so we type them in a file and tell Python to run the
    the commands in the file

    In a sense, we are "Giving python a script"

    As a convention, we add ".py" as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python

Sequential Steps

    When a program is running, it flows from one step to the next. As programmers, we set up "paths" for the program to follow.
    
Conditional Steps
Repeated Steps
