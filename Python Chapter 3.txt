Conditional Execution
    Boolean expression
        Ask a question and produce a Yes or No result
        which we use to control
    Boolean expressions using comparision operators evaluate to True / False or Yes / No
    Comparison operators look at variables but do not change the variables

    < Less than
    <= less than or Equal to
    == Equal to
    >= Greater than or Equal to
    > Greater than
    != Not Equal

Indentation
    Increase indent after an if statement or for statement (after :)
    Maintain indent to indicate the scope of the block (Which lines are affected by the if/for)
    Reduce indent back to the level of the if statement or for statement to indicate the end of the block
    Blank lines are ignored - They do not affect Indentation
    comments on the line by themselves are ignored with regard to Indentation

    Warning: Turn off Tabs
    Atom automatically uses spaces for files with ".py" extetion (nice!)
    Most text editors can tunr tabs into spaces - makes sure to enable this feature
    
    Python cares a *lot* about how far a line is indented. If you mix tabs and spaces, you may get indentation errors

Conditional structures
    Multi-Way
    Try and Except Structure
        You surround a dangerous section of code with try and Except
        If the code in the try works - the except is skipped
        If the code in the try fails - it jumps to the except section
